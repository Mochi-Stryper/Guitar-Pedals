Notes:
Capacitors C1 & C2 are intended to be mounted with care. The capacitors are liable to short the components below them if they are mounted radially directly above their silkscreen. Instead, they may be bent to hover off-board. It is not advisable to mount them on the potentiometer side of the board without bending their leads so that they hang off-board.
This layout may be reduced by mounting airwires to the potentiometer lugs in the tone summing section. For instance, the nets for Low 1, Mid 1, and High 1 can be connected via airwires that share plated through holes with the potentiometer legs. The same arrangement can be utilized for Low 3, Mid 3, and High 3. Additionally, the board may be slimmed down by a fraction of an inch and the ground planes may be connected by the potentiometers' chassis ground lugs with airwires in a similar manner.
