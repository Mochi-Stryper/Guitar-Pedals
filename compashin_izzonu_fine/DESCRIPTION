Build Error 11/2/2020: CD1 is a normally connected jumper connecting D2 and D3 to ground. If external diodes are used, then the external diodes/switch must be bridged to N$14 and externally connected to ground. Fortunately, an ounce of puzzled bewilderment and a malleable pair of diode leads can be oriented in such a way that a switch and external diodes can be wired up to the given pads. Best of luck.
