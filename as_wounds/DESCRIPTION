Notes:
There is a six pin header on the effect board that can mate to the switch PCB. In a terribly unconscientious design decision I've opted to name a pad LED+. This pad is connected to a 3PDT switch which mates to the positive terminal of two LEDs. These LEDs indicate the channel that is active in the filter section. Happy Building.
Further Reading: 
I'm dismissive of the functionality of this particular layout. Unfortunately, my notation isn't terribly legible. Hopefully, someone may find it helpful.
I find that the gain recovery stage may be more aptly modelled after a LPB1 with the collectors receiving power and the emitters to ground. Implementing the volume control prior to the boost circuit is perhaps not the most effective in terms of processing. However, I'd like to finish the layout for the hell of it.
Best of luck.
